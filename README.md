# Gabi: The Full-Stack Dad
Welcome to the chaotic yet fulfilling world of Gabi, a 30-year-old full-stack developer who's mastering the art of juggling code, kids, and personal passions!

You'll find my desk to be a true reflection of my life: a delightful mishmash of coding manuals, coffee mugs, toy cars, and action figures.

# Who Am I?
- Dad Life: Juggling two energetic kids and navigating a maze of toys to get to my keyboard.
- Coding Wizard: A .NET and Angular enthusiast with 8 years of experience building digital empires. I can debug a program faster than you can say "JavaScript framework" (even while building a Lego masterpiece!). And yes, I wear glasses – that's how I C# so clearly!
- Sports Fanatic: When I'm not coding, I'm glued to basketball games, analyzing every play like a seasoned coach.
- Car Enthusiast: My enthusiasm for fast cars rivals my love for coffee, and I'm often dreaming about my next car upgrade.

# What I Do
By day, I'm building robust applications with the precision of a surgeon and the speed of a race car driver. By night (after the little ones are asleep), you'll find me either deep in a basketball game or researching my next car upgrade.

I'm living proof that you can be a dad, a caffeine-fueled coding wizard, a sports fanatic, and a car enthusiast all rolled into one – without losing your sense of humor (or your mind!).
